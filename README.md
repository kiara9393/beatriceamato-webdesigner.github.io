# beatriceamato-webdesigner.github.io

I am Beatrice Amato (Art-Director and Graphic Web Designer).
This project is a personal site where you can get to know me better, download my resume, see my portfolio with projects and clients I have personally followed and finally you can contact me.
The Graphics of this site, cv and portfolio, are entirely taken care of by me with Figma.
